/**
 * \file    .github/scripts/check-test-file-placement.php
 * \brief   Refuses a new PHPUnit file when the module source it tests already has one.
 * \remarks A test file costs a class, a bootstrap, a header and one more place to look; a method in
 *          an existing file costs a method. The rule is one test file per source file under test,
 *          and what a file tests is read from its own dol_include_once() lines. Only files ADDED by
 *          the pull request are checked, so the existing suite is never a reason to fail.
 *
 *          Usage: php .github/scripts/check-test-file-placement.php <base ref>
